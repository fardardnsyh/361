I contribute with development of a tool for the management process of ambulance departures from the headquarters of the Portuguese Red Cross located in the city of Amares. It provides an intuitive and efficient interface for rescuers to record occurrences, avoiding possible mistakes at the time of registration, thus speeding up and standardizing the same. It has features for managing the tribulation, available ambulances, and user levels in the system. Saving all occurrences in a digital medium makes it easier to retrieve departure data, thus generating a complete history of all departures and who recorded them.

It has different types of registrations to speed up the registration process, and also has a module for managing ambulances that is linked to the registration module, allowing control of which ambulance is available for use.

I implemented the central record functionality, converting business rules into an efficient software solution. The system allows edits within a stipulated maximum time and ensures that users only see the records they have registered. On the dashboard, recent records are easily accessible and available for editing, providing an optimized user experience focused on efficiency. In addition, in the records section, there are date filters that allow for a quick and accurate search for occurrences, facilitating the management and recovery of information.
